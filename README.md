# Pattern Rewriting
<p>
A pattern matching and rewrite-rule system in lisp (being translated into Java) with application to equation solving, symbolic computation, automated theorem proving, translation between programming languages, and grammatical analysis and transformation of sentences. Many of the examples in the code base already are symbolic computation problems, and I intend to add an extended application in parsing and transforming Latin sentences.

#### How can I see it work?

I've included a short demo program for the lisp/racket implementation, in a file called demo.rkt in the racket/ directory.

Install racket, so that you have the racket terminal command, from the following link: https://download.racket-lang.org/

Next, follow the directions at the top of the demo.rkt file. It currently contains 5 short examples of what the computer algebra system can do.
